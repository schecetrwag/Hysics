I got here because of iptables really, reading about firewall settings, watching videos and just
trying to understand the basics of networking and how to set up my laptop workstation so i can
control the traffic. Being aware of what is ingressing and what is on the outbound, how it relates to de WWW 
and getting a bigger picture of this crazy technology that surrounds us day to day.

My goal is to have a solid understanding of every aspect of computing in general and specialize in Network security and Pentesting. I love astronomy, im fascinated by physics and how the world really is. 

Hope i can contribute something useful to this site and users, although i have to learn a lot before i can upload any
useful code here...But that's life, always learning something which you knew nothing about the day before.


Have a nice experience in this enviromental spacetime we call life, enjoy what you do and don't forget to
always look at the bright side of life(at least until the sun doesn't expand as far out as Mercury, Venus, and maybe even Earth vaporizing us all).
